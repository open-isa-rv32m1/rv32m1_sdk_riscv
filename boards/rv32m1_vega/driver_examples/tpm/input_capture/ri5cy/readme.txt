Overview
========
The TPM project is a demonstration program of the SDK TPM driver's input capture feature.
The example sets up a TPM channel for dual-edge capture. Once the input signal is received,
this example will print the capture value.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC RISC-V Embedded 7.1.1
- RISC-V Eclipse IDE 4.7.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- RV32M1-VEGA board
- Personal Computer


Board settings
==============
M0 core: Connect input signal to PTB13(J1-8).
M4 core: Connect input signal to PTB2(J2-2).

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2. Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see information from the terminal as below.
