Overview
========
The True Random Number Generator (TRNG) is a hardware accelerator module that generates a 512-bit
entropy as needed by an entropy consuming module or by other post processing functions. The TRNG
Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to generate random numbers
and prints them to the terminal.



Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC RISC-V Embedded 7.1.1
- RISC-V Eclipse IDE 4.7.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- RV32M1-VEGA board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This example project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board's jumper settings
and configurations in default state when running this example.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
